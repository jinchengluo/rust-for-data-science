# Rust for Data Science

This is a guide for Data Scientists and Machine Learning learners that seek to learn **Rust** from scratch alongside with **Cargo**, its package manager tool, and **PyO3**, a Rust library that gives developers a direct access to manually written Rust functions from Python files with simple imports.

This guide is divided in four parts : 
1. [**Basics of Rust**](./rust.md)
2. [**Basics of Cargo**](./cargo.md)
3. [**How to use PyO3**](./pyo3.md)
4. [**Applications and tests**](./applications.md)
